	<h1><b>Queens Resident Trouble with Shelters</h1></b>
	<h2> <font face="verdana">By Josh Futtersak<h2>

	<p>The crowd booed and jeered as Kareena Dozier, communications director at the Department of Homeless Services, tried to explain the sudden opening of its newest shelter, The Landing, in East Elmhurst. The meeting was held at the AME Church in East Elmhurst a few weeks ago to address concerns from community residents. While some waited in line for their chance to speak at the microphone, others called out from the crowd, shouting down Dozier and at one point, reduced her to tears with insults.

<p>As New York City struggles to cope with the homelessness crisis, 60,000 residents are living NYC shelters. That number is up over 69 percent since Mayor de Blasio took office according to Coalition For The Homeless. According to City Council the city has authorized the building of emergency shelters in former hotels and warehouses without the consent of any community residents or council members. Community residents say that the shelters are operating without necessary utilities, such as functional kitchens. The DHS has never tried to deny that fact.</p>

The Landing was formerly known as the Clarion Hotel before it went out of business late last year. The DHS assured residents that the defunct hotel would not be turned into a shelter, according to reporting by the Queens Chronicle. But in August, 169 units were filled with homeless families.

<p>A group of community residents formed an organized called “Elmhurst United,” with the goal of increasing support for Mayor de Blasio’s original plan of moving away from the shelter system and toward affordable housing. The group points out that there are enough vacancies in apartments and homes that every homeless person could find affordable housing.</p>

		If you look around at the signs in this neighborhood, a house is only $1,300 or $1,400 a month. You can fit three or four people in there easily. This is a terrible waste of tax dollars, </p>

<p>The DHS has created a community advisory board that will meet with local leaders to decide on how to better aide the community residents concerns. Their first meeting will be later this month.</p> 

<p>“The DHS lies about opening up shelters,” said Elmhurst resident John Shafer. “They wait until the last minute to tell us. They are illegal shelters.” </p>

<p>Community District 3, which is composed of neighborhoods that include East Elmhurst, Jackson Heights and North Corona, already had another shelter created from the defunct Pan American hotel. That shelter had similar living facilities and was met with much criticism. </P> 

<p>Although the shelter at the Pan American was considered temporary by the DHS, it is still fully operational and without a permanent license. The non-profit “Samaritan Village” is currently operating it on an extended temporary license. This has pitted city agencies against each other with the DHS fighting for the shelter to remain open, and Comptroller Scott Stringer calling for its closing. Stringer has cited rat infestations and health code violations as the reason for its closing while residents say crime has increased. According to Deputy Inspector Ronald Leyson, crime has actually decreased since the Pan American was converted into a shelter.</p>

<p>When asked to comment on the validity of residents fears, a DHS spokespersons responded, “Like the majority of DHS clients, those residing at The Landing are families with young children that have no other place to live and are trying to return to independent living. To conflate homelessness with crime is offensive and patently wrong.”
